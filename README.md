---

## **Step 1: Firebase Project Setup** ‚òÅÔ∏è

This is the backbone of your application.

1.  **Create Firebase Project**: Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2.  **Enable Firestore**:
    * Go to **Build > Firestore Database** and create a database in **production mode**.
    * Go to the **Rules** tab and paste the security rules provided in the project files to protect user data.
3.  **Enable Authentication**:
    * Go to **Build > Authentication > Sign-in method**.
    * Enable the **Email/Password** and **Google** providers.
4.  **Get Frontend Config Keys**:
    * Go to **Project Settings (‚öôÔ∏è) > General**.
    * Under "Your apps," click the web icon (`</>`) to create a new web app.
    * Copy the `firebaseConfig` object. You'll need this for the frontend.
5.  **Get Backend Service Account Key**:
    * Go to **Project Settings > Service accounts**.
    * Click "Generate new private key."
    * Rename the downloaded JSON file to `firebase-credentials.json` and place it in the `backend/` directory. **This file is secret and should never be committed to GitHub.**

## **Step 2: Local Development Setup** üíª

This section guides you through setting up all parts of the application on your local machine.

### **2a. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/twofold-app.git](https://github.com/your-username/twofold-app.git)
cd twofold-app
````

### **2b. Backend (Flask) Setup**

This server handles the AI logic.

  * `cd backend`
  * `python -m venv venv`
  * `source venv/bin/activate` (or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows)
  * `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  * Create a `.env` file and add your credentials:
    ```
    GCP_PROJECT="your-firebase-project-id"
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"
    GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="firebase-credentials.json"
    ```
  * `cd ..` (return to the root directory)

### **2c. Backend (Cloud Functions) Setup**

This server handles secure operations like the couple invitation system.

1.  **Log in to Firebase**:
    ```bash
    firebase login
    ```
2.  **Initialize Functions**: In the project's root directory, run:
    ```bash
    firebase init functions
    ```
      * Answer the prompts: Use an `existing project`, select `JavaScript`, use `ESLint`, and install dependencies now.
3.  **Add Function Code**: Replace the contents of the newly created `functions/index.js` file with the code from the project's source.
4.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    cd functions
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

### **2d. Local Emulator Setup**

This allows you to run a simulated Firebase environment on your machine for easy testing.

1.  **Initialize Emulators**: In the project's root directory, run:
    ```bash
    firebase init emulators
    ```
2.  **Select Emulators**: Use the spacebar to select `Functions`, `Firestore`, and `Authentication`.
3.  **Configure Ports**: Press Enter to accept the default ports for each.
4.  **Enable UI**: Select `Yes` to enable the Emulator UI, a powerful debugging tool.
5.  **Download Emulators**: Select `Yes` to download the required files.

### **2e. Frontend (React) Setup**

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
      * `cd frontend`
      * `npm install`
2.  **Create Environment File**: Create a `.env.local` file and paste your Firebase web app keys:
    ```
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
    # ... and the rest of the keys
    REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=[http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)
    ```
3.  **Connect Frontend to Emulators**: **This is a crucial step for local testing.** Replace the contents of `frontend/src/api/firebase.js` with the following to ensure your app talks to the local emulators:
    ```javascript
    // File: frontend/src/api/firebase.js
    import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
    import { getAuth, connectAuthEmulator } from "firebase/auth";
    import { getFirestore, connectFirestoreEmulator } from "firebase/firestore";
    import { getFunctions, connectFunctionsEmulator } from "firebase/functions";

    const firebaseConfig = { /* Your config keys here */ };

    const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
    const auth = getAuth(app);
    const db = getFirestore(app);
    const functions = getFunctions(app);

    // Connect to emulators when running locally
    if (window.location.hostname === "localhost") {
      console.log("Testing locally: Connecting to emulators.");
      connectAuthEmulator(auth, "http://localhost:9099");
      connectFirestoreEmulator(db, "localhost", 8080);
      connectFunctionsEmulator(functions, "localhost", 5001);
    }

    export { auth, db, functions };
    ```

-----

## **Step 3: Running & Testing Locally** üöÄ

To test the full app, you'll run three services simultaneously. Open three separate terminals.

  * **Terminal 1 (Root Dir): Start Firebase Emulators**

    > This runs a local version of Cloud Functions, Auth, and Firestore.

    ```bash
    firebase emulators:start
    ```

    > **View the Emulator UI at `http://localhost:4000` to see your local database, function logs, and auth state in real-time.**

  * **Terminal 2 (`backend/` Dir): Start Flask Backend**

    > This runs the Python server that handles AI agent logic.

    ```bash
    cd backend
    source venv/bin/activate
    flask run
    ```

  * **Terminal 3 (`frontend/` Dir): Start React Frontend**

    > This serves the user interface.

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm start
    ```

Now open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser and test the complete sign-up, couple invitation, and diary submission flow.

-----

## **Step 4: Deploying the Backend Services** üåê

1.  **Deploy the Cloud Function**:
    ```bash
    firebase deploy --only functions
    ```
2.  **Deploy the Flask Backend to Cloud Run**:
      * Authenticate and set your project: `gcloud auth login` and `gcloud config set project your-firebase-project-id`.
      * From the `backend/` directory, run the deploy command:
        ```bash
        gcloud run deploy twofold-backend --source . --region your-region --allow-unauthenticated --set-env-vars="GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key"
        ```
      * **Copy the final Service URL.**

-----

## **Step 5: Deploying the Frontend** ‚ú®

We'll use Cloudflare Pages as an example.

1.  **Push to GitHub**: Make sure your latest code is pushed to your GitHub repository.
2.  **Configure Cloudflare Pages**:
      * In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to **Workers & Pages \> Create application \> Pages \> Connect to Git**.
      * Select your repository.
      * Use the following build settings:
          * **Framework preset**: `Create React App`
          * **Root Directory**: `frontend`
          * **Build command**: `npm run build`
          * **Build output directory**: `frontend/build`
      * **Set Environment Variables**: In the settings, add all your `REACT_APP_...` variables. **Crucially, update `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` to the Service URL you got from Cloud Run in the previous step.**
3.  **Save and Deploy**. Your app is now live\!
